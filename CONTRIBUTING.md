# Contributing to VisualEngine

Everything is appreciated. If you want to help build this, just jump in. 

### How to Help
If you see something that sucks, fix it. If you have a better way to handle the renderer or the math, open a PR. You don't need to write a thesis for your pull request, if the code makes the engine better, it's a win.



### Process
1. Fork it.
2. Code it.
3. Open a PR.
