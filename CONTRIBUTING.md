# Contributing to VisualEngine

Everything is appreciated. If you want to help build this, just jump in. 

### The Rules
* **Project Structure:** There is only **one** project called `VisualEngine`. It has everything, the core, the renderer, and the **Wrench** editor. No need to overcomplicate it.
* **Code Style:** I don't care about specific naming conventions, indentation, or where you put your braces. Just keep it **knowable**. If a human can read it and understand what it's doing, it's good.
* **The Vision:** We are making a node-based engine that feels like Godot but hits like Source. If a feature makes it feel bloated or slow, we don't need it.

### How to Help
If you see something that sucks, fix it. If you have a better way to handle the renderer or the math, open a PR. You don't need to write a thesis for your pull request, if the code makes the engine better, it's a win.



### Process
1. Fork it.
2. Code it.
3. Open a PR.
